# parity-model-train-yard

`parity-model-train-yard` packages a practical ml utilities exercise in Haskell. The emphasis is on deterministic behavior, a small public API, and examples that explain the tradeoffs.

## How I Read Parity Model Train Yard

The useful thing to inspect here is how the same score rule is represented in code, metadata, and examples. If those three pieces disagree, the audit script should make the drift visible.

## Problem Shape

This project keeps the domain idea close to the tests. That makes it useful as a reference implementation, a small experiment, or a starting point for a more specialized tool.

## Main Behaviors

- Models feature signals with deterministic scoring and explicit review decisions.
- Uses fixture data to keep metric checks changes visible in code review.
- Includes extended examples for windowed behavior, including `surge` and `degraded`.
- Documents explainable outputs tradeoffs in `docs/operations.md`.
- Runs locally with a single verification command and no external credentials.

## Internal Model

The core is a scoring model over demand, capacity, latency, risk, and weight. That keeps feature signals, metric checks, and windowed behavior in one explicit decision path. The threshold is 183, with risk penalty 4, latency penalty 4, and weight bonus 2. The Haskell code keeps the pure scoring function isolated so tests can check it without setup.

## Repository Map

- `src`: primary implementation
- `tests`: verification harness
- `fixtures`: compact golden scenarios
- `examples`: expanded scenario set
- `metadata`: project constants and verification metadata
- `docs`: operations and extension notes
- `scripts`: local verification and audit commands

## Run It Locally

Clone the repository, enter the directory, and run the verifier. No database server, cloud account, or token is required.

## How To Run It

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/verify.ps1
```

This runs the language-level build or test path against the compact fixture set.

## Validation

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/audit.ps1
```

The audit command checks repository structure and README constraints before it delegates to the verifier.

## Scenario Walkthrough

The examples are meant to be readable before they are exhaustive. They cover enough variation to show how latency and risk can pull a decision below the threshold.

## Known Edges

The scoring model is simple by design. More domain-specific behavior should be added through explicit adapters or extra fixture classes rather than hidden constants.

## Follow-Up Work

- Add a comparison mode that shows how decisions change when one signal is adjusted.
- Add a loader for `examples/extended_cases.csv` and promote selected cases into the language test suite.
- Add a short report command that prints the score breakdown for a single scenario.
- Add one more ml utilities fixture that focuses on a malformed or borderline input.
